This corpus contains 180K+ recipes and 700K+ recipe reviews. In this lab, we'll only focus on recipes and **not** on reviews. The recipes are present in `RAW_recipes.csv`.

    "In this exercise you'll cluster recipe names with some of the clustering algorithms we have seen in class. This will also involve making some attempts to pick reasonable hyperparameter values for each clustering method based on the quality of the resulting clusters. For example, for KMeans, you need to specify the number of clusters in advance, which is often challenging on real-world datasets. For DBSCAN, you need to pick appropriate `eps` and `min_samples`. For hierarchical clustering, you need to pick a suitable linkage criterion, distance metric, and prune the tree so that it's possible to visualize and interpret it. \n",

    "Here are some methods which may help you with picking reasonable values for the hyperparameters. \n",

    "- Visualize Silhouette plots. \n",
    "- Visualize resulting clusters using `plot_umap_clusters` function from Exercise 1. \n",

In your solutions, please do not include everything you try. Only present the results of the most informative trials. Add a narrative to your answer so that it's easy for the grader to follow your choices and reasoning.** "
